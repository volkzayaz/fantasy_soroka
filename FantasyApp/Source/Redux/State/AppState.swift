////Why not ReSwift:
///1. AppState should not be nil. It makes little sence having App without any State at all
///2. No Reactive subscriptions available
///3. Absence of Asyncronous Actions
///4. Separation between Actions and Reducers. IMHO they are the same thing.
///  If you use 10 different reducers to handle 1 action, you might as well create single piece of code,
///  that handles this state transform.
///  If you have a state, that is accessed and mutated in the single place, you might as well extract this state into ViewModel
